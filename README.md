# giphy-app-nuxt developed by Mois√©s Laris Santos :swimmer:

### This app was developed with Nuxt using Typescript

This is an app that uses giphy API to deploy GIFs in a beauty Nuxt app.

This app includes the follow libraries:

* Bootstrap 4
* Fontawesome

Check out the [demo](https://giphy-nuxt-mls.herokuapp.com/trending) that was deployed in [Heroku](https://giphy-nuxt-mls.herokuapp.com/trending).

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

## Branches

The app that was deployed in Heroku is the one in the **nuxt-deploy** branch.

This is because some features worked diferently in the production server, this will be fixed in the future.

For now you can check the complete functionality in the **Master** branch.
